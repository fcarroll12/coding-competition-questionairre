## Description


The purpose of this project was to create an interactive coding quiz using HTML,CSS, and Javascript. The user should have been able to see a beginning screen containing the title and start button before seeing the first question appear and a list of options. The user had 75 seconds to then answer the 4 questions before time was up; an incorrect answer subtracted 10 seconds from the time limit. After the short quiz, the final page then listed your final score and another page to view highscores. I learned more about javascript and html however immensly struggled with this assignment and creating the multiple pages for users to scroll through given the time interval limit. I researched on google and youtube as well as class activities but did not have enough time to finish nor could I figure out what I was doing and how to implement these actions using javascript. Given I have no experience using any of these programs I am still proud of achieving a similar mock up using html and css yet frustrated I don't understand how to implement javascript in my own code.
